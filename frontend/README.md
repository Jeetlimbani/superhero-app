### Frontend

The frontend of this application is a modern, single-page application (SPA) built with **React**, leveraging **Material-UI** for a clean and responsive user interface.

#### Key Features

* **Superhero Browser**: Users can browse a comprehensive list of superheroes fetched from our backend API.
* **Superhero Details**: Clicking on a superhero card navigates to a detailed view, showing a complete breakdown of their biography, power stats, and appearance.
* **Favorites Management**: Authenticated users can add or remove superheroes from their favorites list, which persists in the database.
* **Team Recommendations**: The application provides intelligent team recommendations based on hero attributes like strength and intelligence.
* **Admin Panel**: A protected route for administrative users to update superhero information (e.g., name, power stats). Changes made here are persisted in our database.

#### Technology Stack

* **React**: The core JavaScript library for building the user interface.
* **Material-UI (MUI)**: A robust component library for styling and UI elements, ensuring a consistent and modern design.
* **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client used for making API requests to the backend.
* **React Router**: Manages client-side routing, allowing for smooth navigation between different pages without full page reloads.
* **`localStorage`**: Utilized for client-side caching of superhero data to reduce API calls and improve performance.

#### Project Structure

The project follows a modular and scalable directory structure:

* `src/api`: Contains all functions for interacting with the backend API.
* `src/components`: Houses reusable UI components like `Navbar`, `SuperheroCard`, and `FavouriteList`.
* `src/context`: Manages global state, such as user authentication, using React Context.
* `src/pages`: Defines the main views or pages of the application (e.g., `Home.jsx`, `AdminPanel.jsx`).
* `src/routes`: Manages the application's routing logic.
